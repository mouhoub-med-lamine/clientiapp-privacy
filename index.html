<h1>Privacy Policy for ClientiApp</h1>
<p>Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

<p>ClientiApp ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

<h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
<p>ClientiApp works primarily offline. All client data, follow-up notes, and schedules you enter are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit this data to our servers.</p>

<h3>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
<p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain information automatically, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Device information</li>
<li>Advertising ID</li>
<li>App usage data</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is used to provide and improve advertising. You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings.</p>

<p>For more information, please see:<br>
<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>The app may request permission to send push notifications for follow-up reminders. These notifications are handled locally and may use Expo or Firebase services, which may process technical data necessary for message delivery.</p>

<h2>2. Information Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties. The only third-party data processing occurs through Google AdMob for advertising purposes as described above.</p>

<h2>3. Data Security</h2>
<p>Your data is stored locally on your device. We recommend enabling a device passcode or biometric lock to protect your information.</p>
